## Introduction

This front-end application was built as the first solo project for Module 4 of the Back-End Engineering program at Turing School of Software and Design. Students were tasked with designing a back-end API at the end of Module 3 that would be consumed in the initial week of the final mod. For this project, I chose to create a cryptocurrency-based API that consumed data from the CoinCap API as well as the ShapeShift API. This front-end was designed solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Initial Setup

* Clone this repository down into a local directory of your choice.
* Run npm install
* Run npm start

## How to Use

The application serves as a shell/prototype of what would be a more robust application. Both log in buttons will allow the user to access the page without logging in, as the Teller API does not yet have authentication. The navbar will allow the user to access different aspects of the application.

## Known Issues

* Lack of authentication
* Loading screen is needed while asynchronous calls are made to fetch cryptocurrency information
* User does not yet have ability to access menu

## Running Tests

* No tests have been written for this application
